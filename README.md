Scerb
=======

This gem (plugin, whatever you wanna call it...) is for handling templates 
of the `.css.scerb` variety in your Rails application. Which is basically a
`.css.scss.erb` - compiling thusly: `erb` -> `scss` -> `css`. Yeah, that was
just so I could say "thusly".

### FAQ

**What do I need this for?**

**Why is called "Scerb"?**

**How do you pronounce it?**

"sk&#601;rb" - with a hard 'c'

**That's stupid, you should have spelt it with a 'k', don't you know about english grammar?**

Ok...[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c)

Also, I didn't want the name of the gem to sound like a mildly racist term
for an certain nationality of Eastern European.

Wanna argue about how to pronounce GIF now?
