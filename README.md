This gem (plugin, whatever you wanna call it...) is for handling templates 
of the `.css.scss.erb` variety in your Rails application.

### FAQ

**What do I need this for?**

**Why is called "Skerb"?**

**You spelt it with a 'k', why did you do that?**

**That's stupid, you should have spelt it with a 'c'.**
